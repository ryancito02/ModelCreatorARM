# ModelCreatorARM


DESCRIPTION

A program to create JSON models for blocks in ARM architecture, solely for Linux currently.


ADVANTAGES

You can create models to the wildest of your imaginations, as this software is providede FREE and PEN-SOURCE
forked from the original software of the youtuber Mr. Crayfish.

You can texture the models one side at a time.

You can create models and import tthem into texture packs or mods.

If you can figure out how to properly implement these models, you can even create 3D Voxel models for you own game.


DISADVANTAGES

Nasty little bug with speed time when adjusting the current cube/selection in the environment.

You cannot open examples, as your Console will spam ot with Null errors.

We are missing some packages, hence the NULL errors.


PLEAD FOR HELP

Currently, I am alone trying to get this to work on the ARM architecture, and I would like some help from anyone
wishing to help, to figure out how to solve the bugs/disadvantages listed above.

Any and all help is appreciated!
